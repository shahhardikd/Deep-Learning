# Deep-Learning

The aim of this excercise is to learn Deep Learning basics like Neural Nets, CNN's, RNN's etc and apply them for various applications such as -
1. Autonomous driving
2. Image verification
3. Image recognition
4. Image mixing to create art 

and open up the field of Deep Learning to many such applications.

These programming excercises are done as part of the Coursera course - Deep Learning.
