# Deep-Learning

The aim of this excercise is to learn Deep Learning basics like Neural Nets, CNN's, RNN's etc and apply them for various applications such as -
1. Autonomous driving
2. Image verification
3. Image recognition
4. Image mixing to create art 
5. Creating new names of dinosaurs
6. Generating music
7. Creating shakespeare sentences

and open up the field of Deep Learning to many such applications.
